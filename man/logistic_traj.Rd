\title{Seasonal logistic trajectory}
\usage{
logistic_traj(t, offset = 0, a = 2, period = 12, min = 10, max = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{numeric vector of times at which to evaluate the trajectory 
function.}

\item{offset}{numeric. By default \code{t=0} is a local maximum. Offset is
added to \code{t} to allow \code{t=0} to represent a different point in the
cycle.}

\item{a}{numeric slopedness parameter.}

\item{period}{numeric how much time passes before the cycle repeats.}

\item{min}{numeric the smallest value of the cycle.}

\item{max}{numeric the greatest value of the cycle.}
}
\value{
A vector containing a value of \code{level} for every element in
  \code{t}.
}
