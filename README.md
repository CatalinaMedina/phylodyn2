# phylodyn2

New version of [phylodyn](https://github.com/mdkarcher/phylodyn), an R package with the purpose of facilitating phylodynamic inference and analyses.
This package has reduced, specific functionality compared to phylodyn, but its aim is to be well documented and implement methodology developed for accounting for reporting delays in the preferential sampling model for real time analyses (methodology manuscript and repository with analysis to be public soon). 

This package is **not** currently finished, this README will be updated once the package is ready for public use.
