# phylodyn2

This package originated as a copy of [phylodyn](https://github.com/mdkarcher/phylodyn), an R package with the purpose of facilitating phylodynamic inference and analyses.
`phylodyn2` has reduced, specific functionality compared to phylodyn, and it implements methodology developed for accounting for reporting delays, by incorportating reporting probabilities in the preferential sampling model for real-time phylodynamic analyses (methodology manuscript and repository with analysis to be public soon). 

This package is **not** currently finished, this README will be updated once the package is ready for public use.
